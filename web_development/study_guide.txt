HTTP

1.) Describe what HTTP is and the role of the request and the response.
HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is a system of rules that serves as a link between applications. It's an agreement, message format,
of how machines communicate. 
1.) client makes a request to a server
2.) client waits for a response.
(refered to as a request response protocol)

2.) What are the components of an HTTP request and an HTTP response?
HTTP Request consists of: URL, parameters, headers, message body for POST requests. Only the method and URL or path are required.
()Parameters, headers, and body are optional.)
HTTP Response consists of: status code, headers, and message body which contains raw response data. Most the time, header Content-Type is required
which tells how the resources should be read. (Headers and body are optional.)

3.) Identify the components of a URL. Construct a URL that contains a few params and values.
URL has 3 components: URL scheme (http), the host (www.amazon.com), and the URL path (parameters)
http:// www.amazon.com ?car=mazda&color=red

4.) Explain the difference between GET and POST, and know when to choose each.
A GET method request retrieves resources
A POST method request is used when you want to initiate some action on the server or send data.

GET requests should only retrieve content from the server. They can generally be thought of as "read only" operations, 
although there are some subtle exceptions to this rule. For example, consider a webpage that tracks how many times it is viewed. 
GET is still appropriate since the main content of the page doesn't change.

POST requests involve changing values that are stored on the server. Most HTML forms that submit their values to the server will use POST. 
Search forms are a noticeable exception to this rule, and they often use GET since they are not changing any data on the server, only viewing it.

5.) What is the difference between client-side and server-side code? For each file in a Sinatra project, be able to say which it is.



Web

1.) How does an HTML form element interact with the server-side code that processes it.


2.) Why is user-entered content a security risk? Be aware of how to mitigate this risk.
