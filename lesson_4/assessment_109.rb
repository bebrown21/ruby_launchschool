# 1) focus on your vocabulary. Call things by their proper and 
# right terms. For example, don't say "that thing returns nothing"; 
# say "that method returns nil". There's no such thing as "nothing". 
# Don't say "the results of that is 5", 
# say "the return value of that block is the integer 5". 
# Don't say "x = 2 is true", say "x = 3 is truthy, or evaluates to true". 
# Precision of language is paramount, and the assessment will be 
# looking for that.

# 2) focus on the 3 concepts you mentioned in your email below. 
#  with the code and tease out edge cases. 
#  There's depth even in those 3 little concepts. 
#  Don't try to master everything right now, but really hone in on 
#  those 3 concepts. 

# 3) study and practice. Our best students are like valedictorians 
# in high school. They take this seriously; they take notes, 
# make flashcards, practice and rehearse, etc. 
# You should too if you want to compete with them.
